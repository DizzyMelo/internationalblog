# Overview

This web application was created to help international students at BYUI find out valuable information shared by those who have experienced what is like to be an internation student. It was written using the python programming language and the Django framework.

This website intends to provide international students valuable information they usually don't have and take months to learn.

To get the project running, you just have to run the command **py manage.py runserver** if you are on Windows, if you are on Mac run **python3 manage.py runserver**.
